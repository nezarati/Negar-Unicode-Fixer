# Negar Unicode Fixer

Quite a number of applications donâ€™t consider supporting Persian or Arabic language or other languages which are preferred to have especial Unicode form in terms of using Zero Width Non-Joiner or zero width Joiner, which is why I make up my mind about undertaking the project fixing issues with regard to integrating and completing separated activities.

Programs which are presented in this extent are not really versatile because of depending on specialized fonts; therefore, lack of having the compatible character Unicode for already-typed documents would be mutually exclusive with original one. In addition, supporting multilingual contexts are required facilitating switching between languages. Moreover, entering offline text might be substantial, which means that demanding for converting and returning the character Unicode which is typed in standard or non-standard form is indispensable something which is ready in this application is offline text converting: paste or even opening Text file is possible, another point which is deserved to mention is exported Unicode, which is located in menu->file>export->Unicode, the Unicode will be presented in Text file, which can be used by other applications such as J2ME or Polish.

The thing which I have decided to add them in the next version:

    Unicode Keyboard
    Multilingual application
    Multilingual text editor
    Control keyboard key stork
    Fix some bug, especially it seems that the line numbers are reversed in reverse character output mode.
    Console part will be provided.
    Presenting shape of Unicode character is needed below its number.
    Special flowing widget involving showing fonts characters map and preparing choice to choose from.
    Filter the Unicode table in which entering character Unicode in decimal hex or binary will be possible.
    Converting the text to standard and non-standard Unicode.
